# Convolutional Neural-Network for MNIST #
---------------------------------------
An implementation of convolutional neural-network (CNN) for MNIST with various techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, batchnormalization, etc.

Network architecture
CNN with 4 layers has following architecture.

input layer : 784 nodes (MNIST images size)
first convolution layer : 5x5x32
first max-pooling layer
second convolution layer : 5x5x64
second max-pooling layer
third fully-connected layer : 1024 nodes
output layer : 10 nodes (number of class for MNIST)
